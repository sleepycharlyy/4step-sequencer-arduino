# 4step-sequencer-arduino
my first little arduino nano project

its a 4 step sequencer for my arduino with 7 potentiometers 
4 for every step (pitch) and 3 to manipulate the overall bpm, waveform and pitch.
i used 4 leds that blink over the 4 pots every time a step is played.
and one button to turn it on and off.

my code is a bit janky and its my first time programming with an arduino so dont expect to much.
but it seems to work haha.
